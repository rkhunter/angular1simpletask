# Angular 1 Test Task
## Tasks
- [x] Angular 1 application with just routing using the UI router;
- [x] Only 3 text pages;
- [x] Each page must have sub pages (child states);
- [x] Look and feel is up to you.

## Description
This is a master branch with link to Vanilla variant of Angular 1 Simple Task.

No build-tools or boilerplates used.

Since it is a sample task, I have chosen Bootstrap as UI Framework.

It is possible to move the templates into separate files, but Codepen doesn't support multiple HTML Files, so templates were inlined.

Please check the different branch of this repo for variant, which is based on Yeoman generator and uses automated build tool.
